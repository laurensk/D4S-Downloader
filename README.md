  setTimeout(() => {
    data.pages = location.search.split("page=")[1];
    data.pdfsizeW = document.getElementById("jpedal").children[1].children[0].getAttribute("width");
    data.pdfsizeH = document.getElementById("jpedal").children[1].children[0].getAttribute("height");
    console.log(`
    BOOK_ID=${data.id}

## Start Downloading

After you've created and set up your `.env`-file, you can start downloading!
Open a new terminal window in the root directory of the project and execute `npm start`.

You should see the progress of the download in the console and if the PDF-file has been generated, you can use a file explorer to navigate into the subdirectory book/ to find your generated PDF-file.

Note: After the download has finished, the images under book/book_images aren't needed anymore. You can safely delete them.
